Quick Review: To fork this

click the Fork icon in the upper right of this page. This will bring you to GitHub. You may be prompted to choose where to fork — choose your personal GitHub account.
Once your fork is created, click the Code button in GitHub, choose SSH and copy the provided git URL info.
Clone to your local machine with git clone followed by the git URL you copied. This will create a folder in the location you're currently in containing your fork of this lab's repository.
cd into the repository that you just cloned down in the terminal, then run code . to open the files in Visual Studio Code.
create three folders where you will work on your code challenge
Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C - 59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.
NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
