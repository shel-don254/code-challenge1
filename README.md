The 3 code tasks in the Code Challenge are the Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculation. 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem), a programming challenge that asks participants to develop a tool that encourages users to provide student grades. The input range should be 0 to 100. If the marks are larger than 79, the programme must generate A; if they are between 60 and 79, the program should output B. If the marks are between 59 and 49,it should display C, D when they're between 40 and 49, as well as E if they are less than 40. Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Trouble) requires the programmer to design a program that accepts the speed of a car, such as 80, as input. If the speed is below 70, "Ok" should be printed. Otherwise, it should award the driver one demerit point and print the total amount of penalty points per each 5 km/h so over posted limit of speed (70). Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem), in which the programmer must develop a program whose main function is to compute a person's Net Salary using inputs for basic pay and benefits and do the necessary calculations for the payee (i.e. tax), NHIF and NSSF deductions, gross and net salaries.
