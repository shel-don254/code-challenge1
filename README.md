Code Challenge
This repository contains solutions for three code challenges: Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator.

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the corresponding grade:

A: marks > 79
B: 60 <= marks <= 79
C: 50 <= marks <= 59
D: 40 <= marks <= 49
E: marks < 40
Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car. If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the total number of demerit points exceeds 12, the program should print "License suspended".

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
Write a program that calculates an individual's net salary. It should take inputs for basic salary and benefits and perform necessary calculations for taxes (payee), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary. The tax rates and deduction rules should be based on the provided links: KRA and ARENA.
